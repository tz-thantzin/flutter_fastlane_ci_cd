# 🚀 Flutter CI/CD with Fastlane (Firebase Distribution)

Automate your Flutter app distribution to **Firebase App Distribution**
for multiple flavors (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) using **Fastlane**.\
This setup simplifies building and distributing APKs directly to testers
or QA teams.

## 🧪 Running Fastlane

From the root directory, navigate to your Android folder and run one of the following:

``` bash
cd android

# Distribute Dev flavor
fastlane dev

# Distribute Staging flavor
fastlane staging

# Distribute Production flavor
fastlane prod
```

Fastlane will build the APK for the specified flavor and automatically
upload it to Firebase App Distribution.
